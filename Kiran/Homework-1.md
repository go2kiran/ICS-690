## Homework 1
My Best/Worst Case Scenarios for the Semester

Due 3rd class period 1/25

### Instructions
By focusing on a group project, this class has a spectrum of different outcomes that are out of your control. If the group project is not successful, you will need to have a backup plan of making an individual project.
Write up ≈1 page visualizing what your personal best-case outcome is for the semester and the worst case. Delete or adapt the following template. For best case, discuss your dream project and why you are interested in that subject
If you want the group to see your ideas, please submit this homework assignment to your personal GitHub repo under the ICS 690 repo. If you want these ideas to stay private, email this assignment to craig.calcaterra@metrostate.edu

## Best Case
Being a new to the blockchain technology and based on the projects explored personally or discussed during the class, I would like to work on the Chitfund DApp. The Chitfund DApp built is for a public blockchain network using Ethereum. Coming from a community where the chit funds are used, I do believe have enough knowledge on the chit funds and can provide valuable use cases or uncover some of the edge cases. Considering the size of the DApp working as a group will help me and the class to deliver the functional (or most part of it) DApp. This in turn would help me to learn all the aspects involved in a DApp instead of me trying alone and complete only a subset of the DApp. Also, I will be able to learn from others while working as a group, to hear ideas or challenges from the class.

The record of my GitHub commits is proof of my reputation as a software developer. I use that reputation to get fund for the DApp and make it live. I will use the GitHub commits to showcase my contribution towards the Chitfund DApp group project and get an A in the class.

## Worst Case
The group project fails, so I will work on an individual project. Minimally, I’m expected to copy a tutorial and adapt it to finish my own personal DApp. In that case I have decided to work on a Marketplace DApp, because there are lot of interest in Marketplace DApps, and it will be quick to find out a Dapp that can be cloned. A variety of contracts can be established for Marketplace DApps to eliminate middleman for the transactions, this will also improve the transparency and reduce the cost associated with contracts. 

I finish the DApp and publish it on my personal repository on GitHub. It compiles, proving my project works. I write up a presentation explaining what I did and present it at the end of the semester and I get an A in the class. I use this record of my GitHub commits as proof of my reputation as a software developer to enhance the capabilities of the Marketplace Dapp and look forward to implementing the same in real life.

## Worst Worst Case Scenario
If the best and worst case scenarios fail, I will perform a quick review or case study on papers related to DTube or NewDex DApps and prepare a presentation on the same. I will also include the lessons learned from the best and worst case scenarios into the presentation. This would help me to understand the various components involved and how the reputation has been coded. The presentation will guide me as a starting point for any upcoming learnings. As, I have covered all the theoretical details on the project and hope to get an A- in the class.
